## 2024-05-18 - Denial of Logging via Discord Embed Limits
**Vulnerability:** Discord API rejects messages with embed field names >256 chars, values >1024 chars, or >25 fields. The Winston transport failed to enforce these limits, meaning maliciously large logs (e.g., from an attacker) would be rejected by Discord and never recorded, hiding traces of the attack.
**Learning:** Logging integrations that rely on external APIs with strict length/size limits must enforce those limits locally (e.g., via truncation) to prevent "Denial of Logging" attacks where an attacker intentionally generates oversized logs to bypass monitoring.
**Prevention:** Always sanitize and truncate log fields before sending them to external APIs with known constraints (like Discord, Slack, etc.).

## 2025-02-12 - Denial of Logging via Prototype-less Objects
**Vulnerability:** Maliciously crafted prototype-less objects (e.g. `Object.create(null)`) or objects that intentionally throw errors in `.toString()` caused the logging framework to crash the Node process when it attempted to serialize log messages via direct string interpolation.
**Learning:** String interpolation or `.toString()` calls on arbitrary external data should never be trusted, especially in a logging path where "Denial of Logging" attacks can occur by silently triggering unhandled exceptions.
**Prevention:** Implement a robust fallback serialization mechanism (like `safeStringify` combining `String()`, `JSON.stringify()`, and hardcoded defaults inside `try-catch` blocks) before formatting objects for logging transport payloads.

## 2024-05-18 - Log Injection via Unrestricted Discord Mentions
**Vulnerability:** The Winston Discord transport sent string logs directly to the Discord API. This meant if user input contained strings like `@everyone` or `@here`, Discord would parse them and notify the entire server, creating a denial-of-service/spam vector.
**Learning:** External messaging APIs often have their own formatting rules (like mentions) that get applied to plain text. You must explicitly disable these features when sending automated logs.
**Prevention:** Always restrict mentions when sending payloads to Discord by explicitly appending `allowedMentions: { parse: [] }` to the message object. Simple string messages should be wrapped in an object payload.
